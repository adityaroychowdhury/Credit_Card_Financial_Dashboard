# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard

### Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, real-time dashboard using Power BI that offers stakeholders insightful and actionable data regarding key performance metrics and trends in credit card operations. This will enable effective monitoring, analysis, and strategic decision-making.

### Data Sources
The primary data used for this analysis is the "credit_card.csv" and "cust.csv" files. These datasets enable comprehensive analysis and visualization of credit card operations and customer insights.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL database and Server - Importing Data to SQL database
- PowerBI - Creating Interactive Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the financial data to answer key questions, such as :
1. What are the weekly revenue trends across different card types?
2. How does customer satisfaction vary by income group and gender?
3. Which states have the highest number of active credit card users?
4. What is the distribution of transactions by marital status and salary count?
5. How do transaction volumes differ between male and female customers?

### Key Features and Functionality

1. Interactive Weekly Report
- Both dashboards provide real-time updates and insights on a weekly basis, ensuring stakeholders have the most current information available.

2. Filter Components :
- Gender-based filters (Male and Female) to analyze data by gender demographics.
- Income-based filters to segment data by different income groups.
- Card type filters to segregate data based on the type of credit card used.
- Quarter analysis to compare metrics across different quarters.

3. Interactive APIs
- Integration of APIs to fetch and display real-time data dynamically, ensuring the dashboards are always up-to-date with the latest information.

4. Column Charts and Comparative Analysis
- Utilization of column charts to compare different revenue metrics, providing a clear visual representation of performance trends and differences.
